# Honeypotweek11

<h3>Setup</h3>

- Setting up the google cloud account was actually one of the most time consuming parts of the assingment. Google would not accept my edu account, so I had to use my personal email. After familiarizing myself with the google cloud interface. I was able to setup Ubuntu 18.04 Minimal. From there I followed the dirctions of the assingment closely to make the necesary google commands to make the honeypot vm and the MHN-admin with appropriate firewall and network settings.

  - You can see below the attacks report which shows attacks from various IPs and countries.
